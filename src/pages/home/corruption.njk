        <p>Donald Trump's Campaign Manager, Personal Attorney, National Security Advisor, Deputy Campaign Manager, and Foreign Policy Advisor have all been charged with felonies.</p>
        <p>His personal attorney admitted in court that he paid a porn star to keep her affair with Trump quiet, and <span class="highlight">Trump knew about the payment</span>!</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, as Trump continues to attack the Department of Justice, FBI, and national press for uncovering this corruption, <span class="highlight">Mia Love says nothing</span> to defend our important democratic institutions.</p>
        <p>In fact, she is participating in the corruption herself. CNN revealed that <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2018/09/10/politics/mia-love-campaign-funds/index.html">the Love campaign has raised over $1 MILLION in illegal campain contributions!</a></p>
        <p><b>These are NOT the Utah Values we sent Mia Love to Washington to represent!</b></p>
