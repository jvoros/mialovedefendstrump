                <p>Congressional Republicans, in charge of both the House and Senate, failed to hold Donald Trump accountable for this horrific policy. Mia Love hid behind a compromise piece of legislation that claimed to end the policy, <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/storyline/immigration-border-crisis/despite-claims-gop-immigration-bill-would-not-end-family-separation-n883701?cid=public-rss_20180617">but in fact did nothing to end it.</a> And even that toothless compromise failed to pass!</p>
                <p>Utahns overwhelmingly oppose this policy. Why doesn't Mia Love?</p>
